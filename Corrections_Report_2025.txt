# Corrections Report - GAN_EnergiaRenovable

## ðŸ“† Date: April 2025
## ðŸ§  Context:
GAN model training project with Generators based on Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), integrating noise + temporal features as input.

---

This report documents the main corrections made to the `GAN_EnergiaRenovable` project, focusing on the SDE-GAN model. It details the changes made starting from the replacement of the `MLP` model with `FFNN`, its impact, and the technical reasons that motivated each change.

---

## 1. Replacement of `MLP` with `FFNN`

### Change made:
- All instances of the `MLP` model were replaced by `FFNN` (Fully-Connected Feedforward Neural Network) in the files `sde.py`, `sde_gan.py`, and `layers.py`.
- The relevant imports were modified:
  ```python
  from models.layers import FFNN as MLP
  ```

### Reason:
- The original `MLP` class was not implemented in `layers.py`, which caused import errors.
- `FFNN` was identified as the current implementation name for the multilayer neural network model, configured via `FFNNConfig`.

### Implications:
- Enables clearer model parameterization via `FFNNConfig` objects.
- Unifies the code under a more maintainable architecture.

---

## 2. Input Configuration in `embed_config`

### Change made:
- The `in_size` parameter in `gen_embed_config` was updated to:
  ```python
  in_size = gen_noise_size + time_features_size
  ```

### Reason:
- The `FFNN` model expects its input to include both latent noise and temporal features.
- Without this fix, the model threw dimension errors (`mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied`).

### Implications:
- The generator can now learn time-conditional functions.
- Training matches the model architecture.

---

## 3. Fix in `Generator.forward()`

### Change made:
- The embed model input was adjusted in the `forward()` method:
  ```python
  t0 = ts[0].expand(batch_size, 1)
  init_input = torch.cat([init_noise, t0], dim=1)
  x0 = self._initial(init_input)
  ```

### Reason:
- The embed model needs temporal info concatenated with noise to build the initial SDE state.

### Implications:
- Solves matrix multiplication errors.
- Allows the model to train with consistent inputs.

---

## 4. Fixes in `get_sde_dataloader`

### Change made:
- Modified the function to accept `time_features` and use absolute dataset paths.
- Fixed pandas warnings using `.loc[]`.

### Reason:
- Required proper dataset access from Google Drive and support for time-dependent data.

### Implications:
- Ensures preprocessing includes time features.
- Improves portability across environments.

---

## 5. Corrections in `Discriminator`

### Change made:
- The `Discriminator` class was rewritten to properly use `FFNN` and `FFNNConfig`.

### Reason:
- Consistency with the new model scheme defined in `layers.py`.

### Implications:
- The discriminator is now modular and testable.
- Simplifies maintenance and experimentation.

## 6. ðŸ§¨ Original Error

**Message:**
RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (64x1 and 2x16)

**Cause:**
The `Generator` received a `[64, 1]` tensor but its initial network expected `[64, 2]`. This caused a failure in `Linear(in=2, out=16)`.

---

## 7. âœ… Fix in `trainer.py`

**File modified:** `training/trainer.py`

**Changes:**
- `self._fixed_latents` now concatenates noise + time features:
  ```python
  noise = torch.randn(64, self.G._initial_noise_size).to(self.device)
  time_features = torch.full((64, 1), 0.5).to(self.device)
  self._fixed_latents = torch.cat([noise, time_features], dim=1)
  ```

**Impact:** Resolves tensor shape mismatch, enabling consistent sample generation during training.

---

## 8. âœ… Adaptation of `Generator.forward()`

**File modified:** `models/sde.py`

**Change made:**
- The `forward()` method now splits `latent` into `noise` and `time`:
  ```python
  noise = init_latent[:, :-1]
  time = init_latent[:, -1:]
  x0 = self._initial(noise)
  ```

**Impact:** Keeps input dimensions consistent with what the model expects.

---

## 9. âœ… Adjustment in `embed_config`

**File modified:** `train_sdegan.py` (previously `sde.py` at root)

**Change:**
- Modified `embed_config.in_size = 2` to `1`:
  ```python
  gen_noise_embed_config = FFNNConfig(
      in_size=1,  # fixed from 2
      ...
  )
  ```

**Impact:** Matches the actual input (only noise) used by the generator's initial net.

---

## 10. âœ… Project Structure Organization

**Suggestions applied:**
- `models/sde.py` â†’ official module with model architecture
- `sde.py` (root) â†’ renamed to `train_sdegan.py` to avoid confusion

---

## 11. ðŸ”„ Standardized Flow of `latent = noise + time`

- `latent` is generated by concatenating noise + time
- `Generator` internally splits it
- Initial network uses only `noise`
- `drift`, `diffusion`, and `readout` functions may use both

---

## âœ… Final Result

- Model runs with no shape errors
- Training is reproducible
- Coherent data flow
- Solid foundation for documentation and future improvements
